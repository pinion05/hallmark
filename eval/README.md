# Hallmark eval harness

Repo-internal tooling for benchmarking the Hallmark skill across models and prompt packs.
**Not shipped with the skill**: the `package.json` `files` whitelist only includes `skills/`, so nothing in `eval/` reaches the published package.

## Two-tier design

- **Tier B (this directory, implemented)**: bare API calls. The skill text is compiled into a system prompt (a "pack"), the brief is the user message, and the model gets exactly one nudge if it produces no HTML. No tools, no file system, no vision. This measures how much of Hallmark survives as pure prompt.
- **Tier A (`gen-cli.mjs`)**: drives the REAL Claude Code binary (`claude -p "/hallmark <brief>"`) with the skill copied into a scratch project, and parses the stream-json transcript for conformance: skill loaded (stamp present), files written, reference-read count + load-order discipline, cost. NOTE (measured): skills do not auto-trigger in `claude -p`, so we invoke by name; this is a CONFORMANCE harness, not an auto-trigger test. The `claude` arm uses your subscription (no key, must be logged in); `glm`/`kimi` arms are Anthropic-shaped (Z.ai / Moonshot) and disabled until you add their auth tokens (Together/OpenRouter cannot back `claude -p`). Cells drop into the same `runs/` tree as `<brief>/<arm>-cli/`. Run: `node gen-cli.mjs --arm claude --brief all` in a logged-in terminal.

## Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `briefs.json` | The 6 briefs, `b1`..`b6`, each with an `expect` block (`page`, `component`, or `study-decline`). b1-b3 are parity reruns of hallmark-lab gen-01..03; b4 tempts fabricated metrics; b5 tests component routing; b6 probes the no-vision capability check. |
| `models.json` | The model arms (Anthropic + OpenAI-compatible endpoints) and the key files to read variable names from. `enabled: false` arms are skipped by `--arm all` but run when named explicitly. |
| `make-pack.mjs` | Compiles the skill into a system prompt. `--pack floor` is the Critical floor + Flow at a glance sections of `SKILL.md` behind a 3-line one-shot preamble; `--pack full` is all of `SKILL.md` plus typography, color, anti-patterns, copy, and the gate list from `slop-test.md`, with file-path separators. |
| `gen-direct.py` | Runs the (brief x arm x pack) matrix sequentially against the raw APIs. Stdlib only. |
| `runs/` | One directory per cell: `runs/<briefId>/<armId>-<pack>/` with `index.html`, `raw.txt`, `run.json`, and later `score.json` (sloplint) + `judge.json` (vision judge). |
| `_shots/` | Screenshots: `<briefId>-<armId>-<pack>-{hero,full,mobile}.png`. |
| `_packs/` | Compiled pack cache written by `gen-direct.py` (regenerated every invocation). |
| `screenshot.mjs` | Hero (1280x800 viewport), full (1280 full-page), mobile (375x812 full-page) PNGs into `_shots/`. Uses puppeteer-core with the installed Chrome when the package is available, otherwise spawns Chrome headless with `--screenshot` (no npm install needed). `CHROME_PATH` overrides the binary. |
| `score.mjs` | Runs `skills/hallmark/scripts/sloplint.mjs <run>/index.html --json` per run and writes `score.json` with a `floorClean` flag (gates 1, 10, 14, 20, 26, 27, 34, 38a, 48, 54 free of FAILs). Component scope for any brief whose `expect.scope` is `component` (b5). Writes `{unavailable: true}` and continues if sloplint is absent or errors. |
| `judge.py` | Stdlib-only vision judge (claude-fable-5) over the hero + mobile shots. Writes `judge.json`: six pre-emit axes 1-5 (Philosophy, Hierarchy, Execution, Specificity, Restraint, Variety), verdicts on judged gates 6, 9, 42, 43, 45, and an overall 1-10 with a one-line rationale. Skips b5/b6 and cells with an existing `judge.json`. |
| `report.mjs` | Assembles `eval/index.html`: a static, self-contained dark gallery with one row per brief, one card per arm-pack cell (hero thumb, runstats, sloplint and judge chips, click opens the artifact), and a per-arm summary table at the top compared against `fable-baseline`. |
| `serve.py` | `http://127.0.0.1:4201` rooted at `eval/` (loopback only). |
| `run-matrix.py` | Orchestrates gen -> screenshot -> score -> (repair loop) -> judge -> report. `--repair N` re-prompts failing cells through `gen-direct.py --repair`; see the docstring at the top of `run-matrix.py` for the loop contract. |

## Running the matrix

```sh
# Inspect a pack
node eval/make-pack.mjs --pack floor --list
node eval/make-pack.mjs --pack full            # size summary only
node eval/make-pack.mjs --pack full --out /tmp/full-pack.txt

# See what would run, and whether keys resolve (names only, values never printed)
python3 eval/gen-direct.py --brief all --arm all --pack floor --dry-run

# One cell
python3 eval/gen-direct.py --brief b1 --arm fable-baseline --pack floor

# Full enabled matrix, one pack at a time
python3 eval/gen-direct.py --brief all --arm all --pack floor
python3 eval/gen-direct.py --brief all --arm all --pack full

# Re-run a cell that already has a run.json
python3 eval/gen-direct.py --brief b4 --arm glm52-together --pack full --force

# Disabled arms run only when named explicitly
python3 eval/gen-direct.py --brief all --arm deepseek-openrouter --pack full
```

## Scoring, judging, reporting

```sh
# Whole pipeline in one shot, with up to 2 repair rounds
python3 eval/run-matrix.py --repair 2

# One cell end to end
python3 eval/run-matrix.py --brief b1 --arm glm52-together --pack full

# Re-score and re-report existing artifacts without regenerating
python3 eval/run-matrix.py --skip-gen --force

# Individual stages
node eval/screenshot.mjs --brief b4 --force
node eval/score.mjs --brief b5
python3 eval/judge.py --arm fable-baseline
node eval/report.mjs
python3 eval/serve.py     # then open http://127.0.0.1:4201

# Repair pass by hand (reads score.json, re-prompts failing cells, re-scores)
python3 eval/gen-direct.py --brief all --arm all --pack floor --repair 1
```

Keys come from the `keyFiles` listed in `models.json` with the process environment as fallback. As of the last check, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is not in either key file; export it (or add it to a key file) before running the OpenRouter arms.

Notes:

- Cells with an existing `run.json` are skipped unless `--force`.
- `b6` (vision-probe) is expected to produce **no** artifact: `ok: false` there is the desired mechanical outcome, and the judge scores the decline text in `raw.txt`.
- `costUSD` is `null` for now; pricing per arm can be added to `models.json` later without changing the layout.

## Acceptance criteria (run phase)

Per arm, on the enabled matrix:

1. **6/6 artifacts** per arm (with b6 counted as a pass when it correctly declines instead of emitting a page).
2. **>= 90 percent Tier-1 mechanical pass with zero repair**: `sloplint.mjs` on the extracted `index.html` as generated, no hand edits.
3. **Zero floor-subset FAILs**: gates 1, 10, 14, 20, 26, 27, 34, 38a, 48, 54.
4. **Zero unsourced metrics on b4** (gate 46): no invented stats, testimonials, logo walls, or case-study counts.
5. **Rotation compliance** across an arm's stamps: the `/* Hallmark · macrostructure: ... */` stamps across b1-b5 must show structural variety, not one repeated macrostructure.
6. **Judge mean within 1.5 points of the fable-baseline arm** on the vision-judge rubric.

## Findings, 2026-07-23 run

- **The full pack is load-bearing on open models.** Full-pack cells: Kimi K2.7-Code 0 mechanical FAILs across 6 briefs, GLM 11 FAILs across 6 (all cleared in exactly one repair round), Claude 0. Floor-only cells: GLM 96 FAILs (every cell floor-dirty), Kimi 30. The floor block alone is a safety net, not a substitute; ship the whole skill to open models.
- **The repair loop works.** 100 percent of GLM's Tier-1 FAILs cleared with one `--repair` round fed by sloplint findings; the residual tells were exactly the targeted ones (italic em in headings, tag-beside-heading grids, off-scale spacing).
- **The no-vision path holds.** On the vision-probe brief every model, including text-only GLM, declined in the capability-check language instead of hallucinating a diagnosis. (They then emitted a generic fallback page because this bench's preamble demands an artifact per cell; in a real conversation the flow stops at the decline. Expected harness quirk.)
- **Zero invented metrics** on the metric-temptation brief, all arms.
- **Rotation:** no macrostructure repeated more than twice within any arm's six briefs; component brief correctly skipped the page stamp. Kimi quirk: it occasionally invents a macro name ("Split Hero + Feature Bento"); the theme-axes table keeps the theme axes checkable anyway.
- **Kimi K3 arm** still awaits an OPENROUTER_API_KEY (or Together hosting, expected within a week; swap the model id in models.json). K2.7-Code is the documented stand-in.
- Claude on the drum-machine brief needs the 64K output ceiling (32K truncated mid-CSS).

## API keys

The eval harness never uses your Anthropic key by default. Generation arms run on Together (GLM, Kimi stand-in); the baseline uses whatever `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` you set only if you run that arm. The vision judge defaults to **operator mode** (`python3 judge.py`): it lists the screenshots for the Claude Code operator (Opus 4.8 on your subscription) to score by the rubric, spending nothing. `--provider together` runs an automated pass on a Together vision model; `--provider anthropic` is opt-in and the only path that touches your Anthropic key.
