# Theme - Brutal

Raw graphic-design brutalism: heavy grids, slab type, one loud signal. Near-white paper is carved by near-black 3px rules, stacked with giant uppercase Albert Sans 700, and cut by exactly ONE red as a fill-block or bar. It reads like a wayfinding sign or a broadsheet front page: loud, rigid, unhedged.

The material, in one line: **a clean sheet, thick black rules, zero radius, one red cut.**

## Axes (diversification)

- **Paper band** - light (`oklch(98% 0.001 0)`, chroma ~0, hue 0). An engineered near-white, all but neutral. Not tinted, not warm-grey - a clean sheet the black rules bite into.
- **Display style** - **display-heavy**: Albert Sans **700**, run UPPERCASE at `--tracking-display: -0.045em`. `--lh-tight: 1.02` is the floor: below it, cap-tops of line N+1 collide with line N on multi-line all-caps heads.
- **Accent hue** - **warm red** (`#E63946`, text form `oklch(58% 0.24 25)`). One saturated signal, hue ~25. Sits clear of the cool themes; used as a graphic cut, never a wash.

## Reference register

Bloomberg Businessweek graphics · Balenciaga · Gumroad · Cash App · Are.na · MSCHF · Off-White · Read the Docs. **Never name any of these in the output.**

The material to match: the heavy-grid front page and the wayfinding sign - thick black rules, one red bar, type as the structure. Internally: *a broadsheet masthead crossed with a machine-shop label plate* - rigid grid, one red stamp, everything flush to a border.

## Palette

Canonical values live in `site/css/tokens.css` under `[data-theme="brutal"]`.

- `--color-paper: oklch(98% 0.001 0)` - engineered near-white
- `--color-ink: oklch(8% 0.005 0)` - near-black, and the rule colour
- body text `oklch(12% 0.005 0)`
- `--color-muted: oklch(38%)` - mono meta
- `--color-accent: #E63946` - the one red; as text, `--color-accent-ink: oklch(58% 0.24 25)`

Close to `#fff` / `#000` on purpose but never either: the ~0-chroma neutrality is what makes the red read as the only colour on the page. Keep the red under ~5% of any viewport. It cuts; it does not coat.

## Typography

All-sans. No serif anywhere.

- **Display** - Albert Sans 700, UPPERCASE, `--tracking-display: -0.045em`, `--lh-tight: 1.02`, sized by `--text-display` (clamp to 6.5rem). Flush-left, edge-aligned to a rule, allowed to run wide and clip against it. Never centred, never italic.
- **Body** - Albert Sans 400/500.
- **Label** - JetBrains Mono, UPPERCASE, `--tracking-label: 0.04em`, in `--color-muted`. The machine-readout counterpoint to the shouting display: meta rows, table headers, captions, filenames, kbd hints, units, folios, entry numbers inside a real `<ol>`. It records a value; it never introduces a heading.

## Material

- **Thick rules are the structure.** Two weights only: `--rule-fine: 3px` heavy borders box sections and figures; `--rule-hair: 1px` splits rows inside them. Brutalism draws with a marker, not a pencil. Content sits flush to the border with no inset gutter softening it.
- **Zero radius, everywhere.** `border-radius: 0` on buttons, inputs, blocks, images. Square corners are non-negotiable; any rounding reads as a softer sibling and breaks the theme.
- **Inverted solid blocks, no float.** The page reads as stacked filled rectangles: a solid black panel with paper text, a solid red panel, a bordered white panel. No drop-shadow blur, no glass, no card-on-card float - blocks butt against each other and against rules.
- **No texture, no pattern, no ornament.** The rules and the fills are the whole surface treatment.

## Motion

Mechanical and abrupt. Reveals snap or step (a hard `opacity` cut, or a 1-step translate over ~120ms), they do not ease-glide. Hover flips state instantly: a block inverts to `--color-ink` (or `--color-accent`) with paper text, a border thickens to red. No bounce, no parallax, no blur transition, no autoplay. Everything gates behind `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`; reduced-motion ships static and fully visible.

## Voice range

Blunt, declarative, often ALL CAPS. Verbs and nouns, no hedging, no hype. Never *seamless, elegant, delightful, gentle, soft, curated, whimsical, effortless, playful*. Say the thing flat.

## Do-nots (this theme's own failure modes)

- **No rounded corners.** Any `border-radius` > 0 belongs to Cobalt / Coral, not here.
- **No blurred drop-shadows, no glassmorphism.** Depth is borders and solid fills; a hard-offset no-blur shadow is Carnival's decorative move, keep it out.
- **No ornaments, fleurons, or layered offset stacks.** That is Carnival's decorated lane. Brutal is raw.
- **No black paper.** Inversion into a dark ground is Manifesto. Brutal is a **light 98%** sheet with black structure.
- **No second colour, no gradient, no pastel.** Exactly one red signal on near-neutral ink.
- **No serif, no italic display.** Albert Sans and JetBrains Mono only.

## How Brutal differs from its neighbours

| vs | what settles it instantly |
|---|---|
| **Carnival** (editorial maximalist sibling) | Carnival is **decorated**: duo-tone accents, ornaments, hard-offset layered shadows, variable-width type, tinted paper. Brutal is **raw**: near-white paper, one red, thick black borders, no ornament. Decorated vs raw. |
| **Manifesto** (loud editorial sibling) | Manifesto is **BLACK paper** with all-caps red condensed display, inverted polarity. Brutal is a **light 98% sheet** with black structure and a red cut. Light vs dark settles it in one glance. |
| **Riso** (print-craft editorial) | Riso is risograph craft: pink stock, misregistration, soft grainy ink. Brutal is hard-edged and crisp: no texture, no misregistration, heavy exact rules. |

## When the brief routes here

*brutalist · raw · bold · high-contrast · statement · agency · studio · portfolio · streetwear · drop · zine · type-forward · graphic-design · poster · festival · collective · no-nonsense · uncompromising*. Categories: design studios and agencies, streetwear or fashion drops, editorial and zines, type-forward portfolios, event or festival pages, statement landings. Tone: loud, blunt, confident, raw, rigid, unhedged.

Warm, soft, image-led, or intimate briefs route elsewhere (Carnival for decorated maximalism, Manifesto for the dark inversion, the quieter editorial themes for prose).

The rest of the page is yours. Brutal supplies the sheet, the rules, and the one red; what gets stacked between them is the brief's business, not the theme's.
