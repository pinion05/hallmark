# Roadmap

What's next. (v1.3 shipped: the edit-time lint hook, four new themes with the image hook, spec files for all 24 themes, the Tier A conformance harness, and variants v2 with progressive reveal + grafts + thumbnails + scoped injection.)

---

## Now

**Run the eval matrices on real endpoints.** Tier B (`gen-direct.py`) and Tier A (`gen-cli.mjs`) are built. Run the 6-brief matrix on GLM (Together) and Kimi (OpenRouter) for Tier B, and the Claude conformance pass for Tier A in a logged-in terminal; iterate the skill text until the acceptance criteria in `eval/README.md` hold. Add Z.ai + Moonshot tokens to unlock the Tier A open-model arms.

**Measure the variants speedup.** `eval/variants-bench.md` documents the four-config protocol; run it on a real authenticated machine and publish the wall-clock + token table (parallel + sketch + progressive vs the v1 baseline).

**Second example builds for the four new themes.** Each shipped with a canonical `-01`; add a `-02` on a second brief, and marketing cards on the homepage gallery.

---

## Next

**sloplint as an edit-time hook, on by default.** The hook exists (`scripts/install-hook.mjs`) and is opt-in. Consider shipping a project `.claude/settings.json` with it pre-wired, or a one-line prompt in `init`.

**Grow the direction atlas + rate the draw.** More lineages, usage-weighted dealing, a ratings pass so strong directions surface more often.

**Variants v2.1.** Screenshot thumbnails in the picker are in; next: DOM-injection with write-back for non-file-router apps (the hard AST-codemod path deliberately deferred), and a live variants demo wired on usehallmark.com.

**Brand-first flow.** From a short product description, generate a complete brand (palette, type, voice, imagery via the image hook) locked into a `design.md`; then every page builds against it.

**Theme-aware motion tokens.** Per-theme `--dur-micro` / `--dur-short` / `--dur-long`; Atelier should feel slower than Brutal.

**Multi-page coherence.** Lock the brand axes, vary the page-voice axes: different pages of the same site, not different sites.

**`study` reads your own codebase.** Third input mode: a path. Walk the files, extract the tokens + fingerprint in use, emit the same `design.md`.

**Charts reference.** A `data-viz.md`: small multiples over dense singles, one accent + neutrals, the worst chart types banned outright.

---

## Later

- **Per-harness prebuilt bundles.** Compiled copies for Gemini CLI, Copilot, OpenCode and friends, with placeholder substitution per harness.
- **`hallmark explain`** - narrate the choices axis by axis; the skill teaches.
- **Negative-capability rules** - for each anti-pattern, the perceptual reason it fails.
- **Emotion-first prompting** - *nostalgic, optimistic, sceptical* instead of tone adjectives.
- **Sound + haptic policy** - when web sound is acceptable without kitsch.
- **Live preview as an MCP server** - watch, render, screenshot, feed back into the gate sweep (the `--render` tier and `gen-cli.mjs` are the seeds of this).
